  ## This is a React based project that houses a collection of skills and information about my resume, portfolio, and options of contact and reference points. 

  - My motivation for making this project had been a few things. Firstly, I was bored of the 'linktree' links that I have used as a host of link options of things that I assosiate myself wiht and/or share to others, as well as I wanted a place to portray my work I have done in and out of this class. 
  - I built this project to have a place to house all of my work that I have done. This includes web development to photography and videography.
  - This solves the problem of having limited resources to show to people who ask or want to know what I offer and what I have been able to achieve up to this moment in time, 
  - I learned a lot throughout the duration of developing the 1.0 of this portfolio. While this did allow me to become more fluent in React and taught me more about file communication and how React works as a language, I would say I learned more about the MUI React framework throughout the development of this project.
